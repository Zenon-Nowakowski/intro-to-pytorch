    "Now that we've had an introduction to numpy, we'll get to see it in action with another member of the standard scientific computing stack: scipy\n",
    "\n",
    "Scipy is a python library for scientific and technical computing, and its use dates back many years to the beginning of when Python started to become popular. In fact, numpy and scipy share some of the original developers, and were developed alongside each other from the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scipy enables the use of the *ndarray* object within numpy for scientific applications that span everything from high performance computing, to signal analysis, to mathematical methods. Understanding the fundamentals of numpy then allows us to explore these more complicated concepts within scipy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scipy is enabled by several packages within the library as a whole. Some of these include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- constants - common physics and mathematical constants\n",
    "- fft - utilities for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform\n",
    "- ndimage - for image processing\n",
    "- optimize - optimization algorithms\n",
    "- stats - common statistics functions\n",
    "- signal - for signal processing functions"

    "Note that we'll also do some rudimentary matplotlib, to introduce you a little to that library.\n",
